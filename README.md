## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pranali!

<!--
**pranalidivekar/pranalidivekar** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology with a specialization in Distributed Systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a Software Developer with a 2+ years of experience mainly in the backend.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for full-time roles as SWE/SRE
- ðŸ’¬ Got a complex problem that needs solving? Let's see if I can crack it!
- ðŸ“« Reach me @pranalidivekar@gmail.com
- âš¡ Iâ€™m a bit of a weird multitasking wizard â€” can switch between tasks like flipping channels on a remote, always finding the right priority!
